		//What is the Abstraction?
		//Ans: Hiding something. In Java we hide implementation logic.
		
		//2 ways
		
		//1.Abstract Class
		//  0 to 100% abstraction
		// An Abstract Class can hold both abstract methods and as well as concrete methods.
		
		// Can a normal class extend an abstract class? YES
		
		// Can I create the Object of Abstract Class? NO
		
		// Can I make abstract class private? NO
		
		
		//2.Interface
		//Known as pure Abstraction - 100% Abstraction
		
		//Interface allows multiple Inheritance
