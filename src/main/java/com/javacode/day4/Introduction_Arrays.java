public class Introduction_Arrays {
	
	//Array is an object that holds a fixed number of values of homogeneous or similar data-type.
	//Aray is a data structure where we store similar elements
	//Length of an Array is determined at the time of creation and once created, the length of the array is fixed
	//Indexing position of an Array starts with zero.
	
	//Features of Array
	//1. A java variable can be declared like other variables with []
	//2. The variables in the Array are ordered.
	//3. Indexing begins from 0.
	//4. Arrays are objects so the occupy heap memory space
	//5. The direct superclass of an array type is Object
	//6. Arrays are always created at runtime
	//7. Length of an array can be determined using the member length
	//8. The elements of an array are stored in consecutive memo
	
	//Disadvantage of Array
	//1. Fixed size  
	//2. Memory wastage
	//3. Strongly types 
	//4. Reduce performance
	//5. Arrays do not have any add or remove methods
	
	//Advantages
	//1. Store multiple data items using a single name
	//2. We can access any element randomly by using indexes provided by the arrays
	//3. Arrays can be used to implement other data structures like LinkedLists, stacks, quees, trees, graphs
	//4. Primitive type to wrapper classes object conversion will not happen in case of array
